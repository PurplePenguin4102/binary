# binary
A python module for manipulating binary numbers

Currently we have: 
Bin_num to create the new binary object. It will default to 8-bit unsigned binary
Converter converts between unsigned binary and various encodings, alternatively converts from binary to hex, oct or decimal
Logic contains all the basic logical gates for functions
Combination contains all the basic combination circuits: mux, decoder, adder
Sequential (coming soon) contains sequential circuits used for memory: flip-flops, latch
